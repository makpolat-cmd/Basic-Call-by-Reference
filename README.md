# Basic-Call-by-Reference

This code is designed for an AVR microcontroller and implements a simple LED blinking pattern. It sets all pins of Port D as outputs and then enters an infinite loop. In each iteration, it turns on all LEDs connected to Port D, waits for 500 milliseconds, and then swaps the ON and OFF values. This results in the LEDs alternating between fully on and fully off states every 500 milliseconds, creating a blinking effect. The change function is used to swap the ON and OFF values, which effectively toggles the LED states in each iteration.
